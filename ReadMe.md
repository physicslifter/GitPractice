## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to gain comfortability in using Git from the command line. I previously have experience using Git version control through the Github web GUI as well as the desktop interface. In the past, this was sufficient, as I primarily used it for collaboration on projects during my Undergrad. As a Physics student, nobody expected me to be comfortable with the command line, but it is now obvious that becoming comfortable will substantially aid my career development - in scientific research as well as engineering. 

### File 1
FIle 1 (File1.txt) was one of the first test files that I wrote. It contains some simple introduction text that was present in the tutprial that I followed from YouTube (available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE&t=2788s&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh ) The tutorial got kind of slow and I got bored so I just moved on about halfway through and completed the rest on my own.
